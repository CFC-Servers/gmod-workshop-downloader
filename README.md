# gmod-workshop-downloader

When playing on a server, this script automatically makes others download your items from the workshop if they have one of these file types included: mdl, vtf, wav, mp3, ogg, vmt, vtf or png (translating: models, sounds or materials).

This will make everyone see the contents correctly (as long as they aren't buggy, of course), so many ERRORs (missing models) and black and purple textures (missing textures) will be "fixed" without the need of manually subscribing to millions of contents!

Besides that, if you have Pointshop this addon also display any unused models.

In short:
It's the best solution for your server, only the right workshop files are selected;
Play with your friends easily, don't ask them to subscribe to your addons;
Don't spend time making a script manually, make it really automatic as it should be!
